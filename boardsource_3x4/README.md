# Boardsource 3x4

## Overview

This is my config for the Boardsource 3x4 macro.

Link: https://boardsource.xyz/store/5ecc2008eee64242946c98c1

I plan to use this for bootloader shortcuts + macros for zoom and Google Hangouts.

## Commands

- `qmk push boardsource_3x4` : build and push firmware

## Bugs

- Despite enabling bootmagic, the wrapper mods `LGUI(...)` don't appear to change to `LCTL(...)`. Investigating.
